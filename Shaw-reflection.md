#Reflection

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

1. I didn't fully comprehend what the staging command (git add) meant until this GPS. 

* What conceps were clarified during the GPS? 

2. In addition to the git add command, the push/pull commands became far more clear.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide? 

3. My pair and I frequently discussed what we thought would be ideal commit descriptions.  We consulted our guide only a few times to clarify some command definitions. 

* What still confuses you about Git? 

4. It is somewhat paradoxical because it feels oversaturated with steps, but each individual step seems necessary at the same time. 

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS? 

5. I thought it went really well - both my pair and the guide were really easy to converse with and the screensharing tool on Google hangout kept us all on the same page (pun intended).
